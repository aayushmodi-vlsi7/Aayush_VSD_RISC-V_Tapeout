## 📌 **Program Overview**

The **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** by **VLSI System Design (VSD)** is an initiative to empower **3500+ participants** in designing and creating **System-on-Chip (SoC)** solutions using **open-source EDA tools**. From **RTL to GDSII**, participants will cover the full spectrum of chip design, contributing to India’s semiconductor growth.

### 🔑 **Key Highlights**
- **Collaborative Learning**: Work with experts from **IIT Gandhinagar** and **VLSI professionals**.
- **Hands-on Experience**: Engage in practical design and simulation of SoCs.
- **Top 50 Students**: Opportunity to work with **industry-grade Synopsys tools** and mentorship from professors.
