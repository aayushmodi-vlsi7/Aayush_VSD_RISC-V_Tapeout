## 🎯 **About the Program**

The **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** is a major initiative by **VLSI System Design (VSD)** that aims to empower over **3500+ participants** to contribute towards India’s semiconductor ecosystem. This program covers the entire SoC design process, from **RTL to GDSII**, with the use of **open-source EDA tools**.

**In collaboration with IIT Gandhinagar**, this initiative offers hands-on training, mentorship, and an opportunity to be at the forefront of India’s open-source semiconductor design revolution.

### 🎓 **Top 50 Students Will Get**:
- Direct mentorship under **IIT Gandhinagar professors**.
- Hands-on experience with **industry-grade Synopsys tools**.
